# Elara Protocol

**A Post-Quantum Universal Validation Layer for Digital Work**

---

## What is this?

The Elara Protocol is a three-layer architecture for cryptographically validating all forms of digital work — from a poem written on a $30 phone in Kenya to telemetry data from a Mars colony operations center.

- **Layer 1: Local Validation** — Hash, sign, prove. Works offline, on any device, in under 50ms. Post-quantum from genesis.
- **Layer 2: Network Consensus** — Adaptive Witness Consensus (AWC) across partitioned networks, including interplanetary delays.
- **Layer 3: AI Intelligence** — Persistent cognitive architecture for pattern recognition, anomaly detection, and collective learning across the network.

The minimum viable network is **one device**. No blockchain required. No cloud dependency. No subscription.

## Architecture

```
Device Spectrum                      What They Run
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Microcontroller (factory sensor)     Layer 1 only
$30 Phone (Kenya)                    Layer 1 only
Laptop (developer)                   Layer 1 + 2
GPU Server (network node)            Layer 1 + 2 + 3 (Elara Core)
```

**No layer depends on the layers above it.** Layer 1 is universal. Layer 2 is accessible. Layer 3 is powerful. The girl in Kenya never needs a GPU. The factory microcontroller never needs Python. They validate locally, for free, with post-quantum cryptographic proof.

Dedicated Elara Core nodes provide AI intelligence *to the network* — pattern detection across millions of validations, anomaly alerts, cognitive models that strengthen over time, creative drift that discovers unexpected connections.

## Key Innovation: The Directed Acyclic Mesh (DAM)

The protocol introduces a novel data structure — the **Directed Acyclic Mesh** — extending DAG architectures with five dimensions:

1. **Time** — Causal ordering without universal clock
2. **Concurrency** — Parallel validation streams
3. **Zone topology** — Partition-tolerant across planetary distances
4. **Classification projection** — Context-dependent views of the same data
5. **AI analysis** — Cognitive layer for pattern discovery

This is not a blockchain. It is a mesh that works when nodes are offline, when light-speed delays span 4-22 minutes, and when the network is partitioned across planets.

## Related: Elara Core (Layer 3 Implementation)

Elara Core is the reference implementation of Layer 3 — a cognitive architecture that gives AI assistants persistent memory, emotional modeling, autonomous reasoning, and self-awareness.

- **PyPI:** `pip install elara-core`
- **Documentation:** [elara.navigatorbuilds.com](https://elara.navigatorbuilds.com)

Elara Core runs locally, thinks continuously, and builds understanding that accumulates over time. It serves both industrial applications (manufacturing monitoring, research assistants, anomaly detection) and emotional companionship systems (humanoid robotics, therapeutic AI, personal companions) from a single codebase — see the [Core Whitepaper](ELARA-CORE-WHITEPAPER.v1.3.0.md), Section 2.3.
